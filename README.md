<h1>Hello, I'm Smaran</h1>

<p>I'm currently a freshman at Brookwood High School, where I'm studying and focusing on Computer Science and Math. Outside of school, I self study math, code projects, write blogs, and work on solving coding problems. I'm also invovled in my school's math and science olympiad team, along with being involved in our CS Club. If you'd like to talk to me, send me an <a href="mailto:timsmaran20@gmail.com" target="_blank">email.</a></p>
